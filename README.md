## Description

The Horiseon website is a website that specializes in optimizing search engines, managing online reputations, and also social media marketing. With a click of a link in the navagation bar, it will  take you to the designated spot. So if you click on Search Engine Optimization, it will move the page down. It will also do it for the other links aswell.

## What I changed:

1. Reviewed the source code and added semantic HTML elements.
2. Structured the HTML elements into a logical structure independent of the css file.
3. All my images have received alt attributes that will be read if the image can not be seen.
4. All of the heading attributes fall into a sequential order
5. My title describes my website

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
